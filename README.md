# Project_TwoPassAssembler - System Software

- Implemented a SIC-XE two-pass assembler using C and C++ language. 

- Input to the assembler is an assembly code with a minimum of 50 lines 
code and we will be generating SYMTAB, Intermediate file, Object code, 
and Object Program as output files. We will be adding some enhancements 
to the assembler by adding error handling

- Finally, we will be comparing both the assembler on basic of time complexity, space complexity, and data structure used.
